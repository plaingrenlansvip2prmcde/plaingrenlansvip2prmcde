Payday loans can be a lifesaver when you have a sudden emergency and need a cash advance fast, but there can be a serious downside to this type of borrowing if you are not careful about who you borrow money from. The danger comes from excessive penalties that are charged on late payments by some of the less scrupulous payday lenders.

Payday loans are quite different to any other type of borrowing. They are a way of accessing extra cash extremely quickly and usually without any kind of credit check. The reason credit checks are not necessary is that payday loans are always for very short periods of time and for relatively small amounts of money. Provided you can demonstrate that you have a job and a bank account, the lender can be pretty sure of getting their money back.

The cost of a payday loan is usually a fixed amount, which will vary with the size of the loan. This charge in itself is perhaps not unreasonable for the service provided, but it is only appropriate as a one-off fee over that short time period. If you were to work out what that charge represented as an annual percentage rate (APR), you would see that it then became astronomical, perhaps a hundred times higher than a typical personal loan. This is because that charge is not meant to be applied over a period of time like the interest on a personal loan would be.
